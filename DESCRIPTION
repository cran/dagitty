Description: A port of the web-based software 'DAGitty', available at 
    <https://dagitty.net>, for analyzing structural causal models 
    (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs).
    This package computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal
    effects, enumerates instrumental variables, derives testable
    implications (d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent
    models, and includes a simple facility for data simulation.
