\title{List Implied Vanishing Tetrads}
\usage{
vanishingTetrads(x, type = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input graph, a DAG.}

\item{type}{restrict output to one level of Kenny's tetrad typology.
Possible values are "within" (homogeneity within constructs; all four
variables have the same parents), "between" (homogeneity between constructs;
two pairs of variables each sharing one parent) 
and "epistemic" (consistency of epistemic correlations; three variables have
the same parent). By default, all tetrads are listed.}
}
\value{
a data frame with four columns, where each row of the form
i,j,k,l means that the tetrad Cov(i,j)Cov(k,l) - Cov(i,k)Cov(j,l) vanishes
(is equal to 0) according to the model.
}
\description{
Interpret the given graph as a structural equation model and list all the
vanishing tetrads that it implies.
}
\examples{
# Specify two-factor model with 4 indicators each
g <- dagitty("dag{{x1 x2 x3 x4} <- x <-> y -> {y1 y2 y3 y4}}")
latents(g) <- c("x","y")

# Check how many tetrads are implied
nrow(vanishingTetrads(g))
# Check how these distribute across the typology
nrow(vanishingTetrads(g,"within"))
nrow(vanishingTetrads(g,"between"))
nrow(vanishingTetrads(g,"epistemic"))
